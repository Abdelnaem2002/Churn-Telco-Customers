In this project, I will build dashboards that will Analyze telecommunication companies' data To determine the reasons for churning out from it!

## Problem:
#### Why do customers churn?
#### How can you improve customer retention?


## Project Summary:
The Customer Churn table contains information on all 7,043 customers 
from a Telecommunications company in California in Q2 2022
Each record represents one customer, and contains details about their demographics, location, tenure, 
subscription services, status for the quarter (joined, stayed, or churned), and more!

### Project Overview
In this Power BI project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of customer churn for a telecom company. The analysis provides insights into customer behavior, demographic patterns, and factors that contribute to customer churn. These insights are vital for businesses to implement targeted strategies for customer retention, reducing churn, and improving customer satisfaction.

### Key Insights and Business Benefits

1. **Customer Demographics Analysis**:
   - **Gender and Marital Status**: The gender split is almost even, and slightly more single customers churn compared to married customers. This insight helps the business understand whether marketing strategies or services should be tailored differently for single customers.
   - **Dependents**: Customers without dependents make up a larger portion of the customer base, and they tend to have month-to-month contracts. The business can offer family-friendly plans or incentives for customers with dependents to enhance retention in this segment.

2. **Age Group Impact**:
   - **Highest Churn Risk Age Groups**: The analysis showed that customers between the ages of 35-50 and 50-60 are the largest segments. However, churn is higher among younger customers (18-25), with significant differences in average monthly charges. Businesses could create customized offers or loyalty programs targeting specific age groups to reduce churn.
   - **GB Downloading by Age**: Younger customers download more data on average. Offering them data-heavy plans could help keep them from switching to competitors.

3. **Average Monthly Charges**:
   - **By Number of Dependents**: Customers with dependents have higher average monthly charges, but they also have a higher likelihood of staying with the company. Offering these customers better loyalty perks could reduce churn.
   - **By Age**: Customers aged 18-25 pay more but churn at higher rates. Adjusting pricing strategies or improving customer service for this group might help reduce churn rates.

4. **Contract Type Influence**:
   - **Contract Duration**: A significant portion of churned customers had month-to-month contracts, while those with longer contracts (one or two years) are less likely to churn. This insight helps the company focus on promoting long-term contracts with better incentives, reducing the likelihood of churn.
   - **Dependents and Contracts**: Customers with dependents are more likely to commit to longer contracts. The business can consider targeted retention efforts toward these customers with value-added services or promotions.

### Business Benefits
- **Targeted Marketing Campaigns**: By understanding the demographics of customers most likely to churn, businesses can tailor marketing campaigns to specific segments, such as young, single customers or those without dependents.
- **Improved Customer Retention**: Offering discounts or improved services to customers with high monthly charges and dependents can increase customer loyalty and reduce churn.
- **Contract Strategy Optimization**: Insights on contract types can guide businesses in offering better incentives for long-term contracts, especially to high-risk groups like younger customers and those on month-to-month plans.
- **Revenue Growth**: By addressing high-churn age groups and providing attractive plans based on usage patterns (e.g., data-heavy plans for younger customers), businesses can reduce churn and boost revenue.


1. Churn Reasons Breakdown

Competitor (841 customers): The largest group of churned customers left due to competitor services, indicating strong competition in the market. This suggests the need for improved competitive strategies like loyalty programs or more competitive pricing.

Attitude (314 customers): A significant portion churned due to attitude-related reasons, highlighting potential issues with customer service. The business can benefit by investing in better training for customer service representatives to enhance customer experience.

Dissatisfaction (303 customers): Customers dissatisfied with the service likely reflect unmet expectations in service quality or product offerings. Addressing customer feedback could reduce churn rates here.

Price (211 customers): Price sensitivity is a concern for a portion of customers. Offering flexible pricing models or promotions may help retain this customer segment.

Other (200 customers): These miscellaneous reasons could be explored further with surveys to gather more specific data and address unanticipated causes.


2. Offers & Services Usage

Offers Percentages: The majority of churned customers (1.05K) are not subscribed to any offers. This indicates an opportunity to upsell or cross-sell new packages to customers who aren‚Äôt engaged with existing offers. For instance, targeted campaigns for Offer E, which has a decent uptake (0.43K), could be expanded.

Internet Types: Fiber optic is the most popular internet type (1.24K churned customers), suggesting that customers using advanced services might still leave due to other issues, such as service quality or pricing. The business can explore whether competitors are offering better fiber optic packages or consider improving their own service.

DSL and Cable Services: Customers using DSL (0.31K) and Cable (0.21K) services churned at lower rates, which may indicate that customers using these lower-tier services are less likely to churn, but possibly due to fewer expectations. There may be room to move these customers to higher-tier services.


3. Contract Types

Month-to-Month Contracts (1.66K customers): The majority of churned customers are on month-to-month contracts, indicating higher flexibility but also a greater churn risk. To mitigate this, the business could offer incentives for customers to sign long-term contracts, such as discounts or bundled services.

One-Year Contracts (0.17K) & Two-Year Contracts (0.05K): Longer-term contracts have lower churn rates, so encouraging more customers to commit to these types of contracts could help in reducing overall churn. However, it‚Äôs also important to ensure that customers perceive value in staying for a longer duration.


4. Geographical Analysis

The map visualization shows churned customers concentrated in specific regions. By identifying these churn hotspots, the business can target regional marketing efforts or focus on improving infrastructure and service quality in those areas. This geographical analysis helps in tailoring location-specific strategies.


Business Insights & Recommendations:

1. Focus on Retaining Price-Sensitive Customers: Introduce more affordable pricing plans or discounts for long-term subscriptions to prevent churn driven by price concerns.


2. Customer Service Enhancement: Address the large portion of customers leaving due to attitude issues. Improved customer service, personalized support, and satisfaction surveys may help mitigate this.


3. Competitive Analysis: Since many customers leave for competitors, understanding the competitive landscape is critical. Enhancing value propositions, such as offering superior network coverage, faster internet, or additional perks, could reduce churn.


4. Boost Engagement with Offers: The high number of churned customers not subscribed to any offers is a missed opportunity. Introducing personalized offers based on usage data may improve customer engagement.


5. Contract Strategy: Increasing the number of customers on one- or two-year contracts by offering additional perks or loyalty rewards can reduce churn significantly.



By addressing these areas, the telecom business can significantly reduce customer churn, improve customer satisfaction, and enhance long-term profitability.
