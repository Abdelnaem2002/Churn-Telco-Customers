In this project, I will build dashboards that will Analyze telecommunication companies' data To determine the reasons for churning out from it!

## Problem:
#### Why do customers churn?
#### How can you improve customer retention?


## Project Summary:
The Customer Churn table contains information on all 7,043 customers 
from a Telecommunications company in California in Q2 2022
Each record represents one customer, and contains details about their demographics, location, tenure, 
subscription services, status for the quarter (joined, stayed, or churned), and more!

### Project Overview
In this Power BI project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of customer churn for a telecom company. The analysis provides insights into customer behavior, demographic patterns, and factors that contribute to customer churn. These insights are vital for businesses to implement targeted strategies for customer retention, reducing churn, and improving customer satisfaction.

### Key Insights and Business Benefits

1. **Customer Demographics Analysis**:
   - **Gender and Marital Status**: The gender split is almost even, and slightly more single customers churn compared to married customers. This insight helps the business understand whether marketing strategies or services should be tailored differently for single customers.
   - **Dependents**: Customers without dependents make up a larger portion of the customer base, and they tend to have month-to-month contracts. The business can offer family-friendly plans or incentives for customers with dependents to enhance retention in this segment.

2. **Age Group Impact**:
   - **Highest Churn Risk Age Groups**: The analysis showed that customers between the ages of 35-50 and 50-60 are the largest segments. However, churn is higher among younger customers (18-25), with significant differences in average monthly charges. Businesses could create customized offers or loyalty programs targeting specific age groups to reduce churn.
   - **GB Downloading by Age**: Younger customers download more data on average. Offering them data-heavy plans could help keep them from switching to competitors.

3. **Average Monthly Charges**:
   - **By Number of Dependents**: Customers with dependents have higher average monthly charges, but they also have a higher likelihood of staying with the company. Offering these customers better loyalty perks could reduce churn.
   - **By Age**: Customers aged 18-25 pay more but churn at higher rates. Adjusting pricing strategies or improving customer service for this group might help reduce churn rates.

4. **Contract Type Influence**:
   - **Contract Duration**: A significant portion of churned customers had month-to-month contracts, while those with longer contracts (one or two years) are less likely to churn. This insight helps the company focus on promoting long-term contracts with better incentives, reducing the likelihood of churn.
   - **Dependents and Contracts**: Customers with dependents are more likely to commit to longer contracts. The business can consider targeted retention efforts toward these customers with value-added services or promotions.

### Business Benefits
- **Targeted Marketing Campaigns**: By understanding the demographics of customers most likely to churn, businesses can tailor marketing campaigns to specific segments, such as young, single customers or those without dependents.
- **Improved Customer Retention**: Offering discounts or improved services to customers with high monthly charges and dependents can increase customer loyalty and reduce churn.
- **Contract Strategy Optimization**: Insights on contract types can guide businesses in offering better incentives for long-term contracts, especially to high-risk groups like younger customers and those on month-to-month plans.
- **Revenue Growth**: By addressing high-churn age groups and providing attractive plans based on usage patterns (e.g., data-heavy plans for younger customers), businesses can reduce churn and boost revenue.



## Key Business Insights:

1. Service Subscription Rates:

Phone and Internet services have the highest subscription rates (90.32% and 78.33%, respectively), indicating these are core services.

Streaming services like TV (38.44%) and Music (35.33%) are less popular, suggesting potential areas for growth through better packaging or offers.



2. Online and Premium Services:

Services such as Online Backup (34.49%) and Online Security (28.67%) have moderate subscription rates, showing room for improvement, possibly by bundling them with core services.

Premium Support (29.02%) and Device Protection (34.39%) may benefit from clearer communication of their value to customers.



3. Offers Effectiveness:

A large percentage (55.05%) of customers have not subscribed to any offers, and the highest subscribed offer (Offer A) has only 11.70% of the customers.

This indicates that the company's offers might not be enticing enough or customers may not be fully aware of them. Re-evaluating the offer strategy could boost engagement and retention.



4. Internet Types:

Cable (43.09%) is the most common internet type, while DSL (23.46%) and Fiber Optic (21.67%) are also significant.

The higher subscription rate for cable internet suggests that customers prefer traditional methods, but there is potential to increase Fiber Optic adoption, which could improve customer satisfaction through faster speeds.



5. Contract Preferences:

Month-to-month contracts (51.26%) dominate, which might indicate that customers value flexibility or have concerns about long-term commitments.

This opens up opportunities to introduce incentives for customers to opt for 1-year (22.01%) or 2-year (26.74%) contracts, improving customer retention.



6. Customer Satisfaction:

Out of the total customers, 1440 are not satisfied, and 2938 are satisfied, with 2665 being neutral.

This shows that while there‚Äôs a large number of satisfied customers, focusing on converting the neutral segment to satisfied and reducing dissatisfaction is critical for reducing churn.



## Potential Business Actions:

Revamp Offer Strategies: Improve awareness or attractiveness of offers to better engage customers and reduce churn.

Bundle Services: Bundle underutilized services (like Streaming or Online Security) with core services to increase their uptake.

Contract Incentives: Introduce loyalty rewards or discounts for customers who opt for longer contracts to stabilize long-term revenue.

Focus on Satisfaction: Analyze the dissatisfaction drivers and improve customer service, network quality, or pricing structures to lower churn risk.


This dashboard equips decision-makers with clear insights into customer preferences, areas needing improvement, and opportunities to enhance customer retention. These insights are crucial for designing strategies that lower churn and boost customer satisfaction.
