#### Improving the company's equipment to suit customer requirements, because this is the most reason for customers to leave
#### Improve customer service : Responding to customer inquiries and complaints quickly and effectively can help build customer loyalty
#### Use customer data to deliver customized offers and promotions : By offering discounts, bonuses and incentives
